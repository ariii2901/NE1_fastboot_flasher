# NE1_fastboot_flasher
Hi all, this script I made it for NOKIA 3 [NE1] to flash the device without authorised OST LA login. This script can able to flash the device in Bootloader locked condition or unlocked condition in fastboot mode, but remember for Bootloader locked condition you need to generate the "Challenge Code" which is paid. For unlocked bootloader condition just run the script &amp; you'll good to go.
Now you guys've a question which one is worth to take (In your mind it is coming for unlocked condition flashing) but I said nah!! you can't erase FRP in bootloader unlocked condition its still required Server access, but once you solved the "Challenge code" calculation you are good to go for all the permission in bootloader locked stage.
The "Challenge key" calculation actually done it by OSTLA "FIH" server, once I generate for you, You no longer required OSTLA official flashing my NE1_fastboot_flasher actually work as OSTLA (It execute the command same as OSTLA by solving "Challenge code" & flash the device in bootloader locked condition & get you all access parameters.
What's the price to generate the Challenge Code? (Only once you need to buy the Challenge Code & I set the price is $5 & 399-INR for Indian users)
